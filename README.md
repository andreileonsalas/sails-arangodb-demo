# Sails ArangoDB Demo

[Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application showcasing the usage of [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) being used via <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-letarte/sails-arangodb">Waterline ArangoDB adapter</a>

Currently, the <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-letarte/sails-arangodb">sails-arangodb</a> driver needs to be manually downloaded and installed from github. This will be changed when the driver and this demo becomes mature enough.
